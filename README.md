# BSRaceRegistration
Bootstrap Version of my Race Registration REPO
A simple update to my first Race Registration Form project. This time, Bootsrap is incorporated in my HTML Markup. This form is done with HTML and Bootstrap only. Thgis project shows off my baseline knowledge of Bootstrap forms, grid and containers. This project was a great way to look back at the progress I've made over the past couple of weeks to look back at my first project. I hope to continue to update this project as my coding knowledge grows and I move onto new languages.
